# Financial Data Analysis Visualization

For our final project in our data visualizations course, we decided to analyze our financial data for the years of 2019 and 2020. We were curious about our spending habits throughout the year as college students and wanted to compare the time periods, categories, and seasons we spent the most money in. With Vega and Vega-Lite, we were able to create a series of visualizations to present our desired results.
