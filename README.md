### Abstract: 
For our final project, we decided to analyze our financial data for the years of 2019 and 2020. We were curious about our spending habits throughout the year as college students and wanted to compare the time periods, categories, and seasons we spent the most money in. With Vega-Lite, we were able to create a series of visualizations to present our desired results. We created a line chart to compare both of our monthly spendings, as well as a parallel coordinate plot to look at the clusters in our data. A scatter plot allowed us to look at individual transactions in a selected time period
