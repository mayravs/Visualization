							Have you ever wondered how much money you spent on a monthly basis? 
							On a yearly basis? How about on a seasonal basis? And where did all 
							this money go? These are questions we asked ourselves and attempted 
							to answer through visualizations we created with Vega/ Vega-lite. 
							Below you will find visualizations ranging from line charts and parallel 
							coordinates plots to interactive scatter plots, bar charts, and radial 
							plots -- all of which display patterns in our spending habits for the 
							years 2019 - 2020. We wanted to look at a full year’s worth of 
							transactions (2019), as well as current data (2020).

								For both accounts, we can see that our spending increases 
								towards the middle of the year, then decreases towards the end 
								of the year. When associating the months in which we have winter, 
								spring, and summer breaks, we can see an increase in our monthly 
								spending. This can likely be due to the more time and freedom we as 
								students have to go out and spend money. This will be later analyzed 
								when looking at the categories in which we spend the most.

							To get a better insight to where our money is going, we plotted our data in the graphs above. These parallel coordinate graphs helps us finds patterns on our spendings based on different categories - Investments, Food, Entertainment, Transportation, Travel, Shopping, Health, Education, and other. For account: 7157,  the deviation of our spendings are very spread out from most of the categories, for example food, shopping and health - this pattern tells us that the spending habits of the use varies per month.  While other months the spendings are clustered at a certain range with few outliers showing a clear pattern on spending. Similarly, for account: 8821, we can clearly identify that this user has a more predictable pattern to her spendings on each category per month with few exceptions.

								The following are interactive visualizations. You can select which account 
								you want to look at, or select “null” to look at both accounts simultaneously. 
								You can also choose to select an interval on the scatter plot which demonstrates 
								all the transactions taken place or simply look at the overall year. This will 
								translate onto the adjacent bar chart, which displays the categories we determined 
								sums up our spending. There are 9 categories in total - definitions for each 
								category can be found below. You can also hover over and click on any bar to 
								see the amount spent on that category, in the selected interval.

								Looking at the entire year of 2019, we can see the outstanding amount spent was by 
								account 7157 on transportation. Overall, we can see that account 7157 generally spends 
								more on most categories than account 8821. Account 7157 spent the most on transportation, 
								with an amount of $4778.56, whereas account 8821 spent the most on shopping with an amount 
								of $3187.13. From this visualization, we can also see that account 7157 didn’t spend any 
								money on investments, and account 8821 didn’t spend any money on travel.

								The other two radial plots are labeled according to which account it is looking at. 
								The drop-down menu can be used to analyze how much was spent for the selected category 
								in each season. Like the other visualizations, you can hover over and click on any

										When looking at the overall year, we can clearly see that when added together, 
										both accounts spend the most money in the summer. This is most likely due to the 
										fact that we have a summer break. There are more activities for us to do, which 
										leads to more spending. For account 7157, it is also apparent that more money is 
										spent in the summer. For account 8821, the amount spent for summer, winter, and 
										spring, are very close. Still, summer wins by a little over $100. For some categories 
										like travel and investment, there are missing radial plots - this is explained in 
										the above section (What do we spend most of our money on?).

						<p style="font-size:20px;color: #2a363b;">
							Analyzing our financial data was definitely an eye-opening experience. 
							We live our lives day-by-day spending money on necessities as well as non-necessities, 
							not really paying attention sometimes to how much we’re really spending. The first time 
							we rendered our graphs we were astonished at how much we actually spent on certain categories. 
							High amounts in categories like transportation confirmed that being commuter students can get 
							expensive on a yearly basis. We also confirmed that most of our spending happens during the 
							months in which we’re on breaks from school. Initially, we thought about taking into account 
							our genders to see how that affected our spending. We later determined that we would need a 
							larger sample of each gender to make more accurate claims. Some of our visualizations did not 
							go as originally planned. This was due to some limitations in Vega/ Vega-lite (more information 
							on this is included in our report). 
							For now, we analyzed our own data. In the future, we plan to allow other users to import their 
							own CSV files containing their transaction statements so that they too can analyze their spending.
